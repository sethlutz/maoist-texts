<h4>Anuradha Ghandy</h4>
<h4>Published March 2006 in <em>People's March</em></h4>
<p>Internationally, one of the most remarkable developments in the capitalist era has been that of the emergence and growth of the women’s movement. For the first time in human history women came out collectively to demand their rights, their place under the sun. The emancipation of women from centuries of oppression became an urgent and immediate question. The movement threw up theoretical analyses and solutions to women’s oppression were put forth. The women’s movement has challenged the present patriarchal, exploitative society, both through its activities and through its theories.</p>
<p>It is not that women were earlier unaware of their oppression. In fact they articulated this oppression in various ways — through folk songs, pithy idioms and poems, paintings, and other forms of art to which they had access. They raved against the injustice that they had to suffer. They interpreted and re-interpreted the myths and the epics to express their viewpoint. The various versions of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, for example, still in circulation among rural women through songs in various parts of India, are a vivid testimony to this. The feudal period saw the emergence of some remarkable women who sought out ways through the means available at the time and became symbols of resistance to the patriarchal set-up. Meerabai, the saint, is only one example among many such who left a lasting impact on society. This is true for all the societies in the world. This was a counter-culture, reflecting the consciousness of the oppressed. However, it was limited by circumstances and unable to find a way out, a path to end the oppression. In most cases, the solution was sought in religion or a personal God.</p>
<p>The development of capitalism brought about a tremendous change in social conditions and thought. The concept of democracy meant that people became important. Liberalism, as a social and political philosophy, led the charge in its early phase. Women from the progressive social classes came forward as a collective. Thus, for the first time in history, a women’s movement emerged that demanded from society their rights and emancipation. This movement has, like all other social movements, had its flows and ebbs. The impact of capitalism, however constricted and distorted in colonies like India, did inspire progressive men and women. A women’s movement in India emerged in the first part of the 20th century. It was a part of this international ferment and yet rooted in the contradictions of Indian society. The theories that emerged in capitalist countries found their way to India and were applied to Indian conditions. The same is true in an even more acute way in the context of the contemporary women’s movement that arose in the late 1960s in the West.</p>
<p>The contemporary women’s movement has posed many more challenges before society because the limits of capitalism in its imperialist phase are now nakedly clear. It had taken much struggle to gain formal legitimacy for the demand for equality. And even after that, equality remained unrealized not just in the backward countries, but even in advanced capitalist countries like the USA and France. The women’s movement now looked for the roots of oppression in the very system of society itself. They analyzed the system of patriarchy and sought its origins in history. They grappled with the social sciences and showed up the male bias inherent in them. They exposed how a patriarchal way of thinking coloured all analyses regarding women’s role in history and contemporary society. Women have a history; women are in history, they said (Gerda Lerner). From a study of history they retrieved the contributions that women had made to the development of human society, to major movements and struggles. They also exposed the gender-based division of labour under capitalism that relegated an overwhelming majority of women to the least skilled, lowest-paid categories. They exposed the way in which the ruling classes, especially the capitalist class, had economically gained from patriarchy. They exposed the patriarchal bias of the state, its laws, and regulations. The feminists analyzed the symbols and traditions of a given society and showed how they perpetuated the patriarchal system. The feminists gave importance to the oral tradition and thus were able to bring to the surface the voice of the women that had been suppressed throughout history. The movement forced men and women to look critically at their own attitudes and thoughts, their actions and words regarding women. The movement challenged the various patriarchal, anti-women attitudes that tainted even progressive and revolutionary movements and affected women’s participation in them. Notwithstanding the theoretical confusions and weaknesses, the feminist movement has contributed significantly to our understanding of the women’s question in the present-day world. The worldwide movement for democracy and socialism has been enriched by the women’s movement.</p>
<p>One of the important characteristics of the contemporary women’s movement has been the effort made by the feminists to theorize on the condition of women. They have entered into the field of philosophy to give a philosophical foundation to their analysis and approach. Women sought philosophies of liberation and grappled with various philosophical trends that they felt could give a vision to their struggle. Various philosophical trends like existentialism, Marxism, anarchism, and liberalism were all studied and adopted by active women in the movement in the United States and then in England. Thus, the feminists are an eclectic group that includes a diverse range of approaches, perspectives, and frameworks depending on the philosophical trend they adopt. Yet they share a commitment to give voice to women’s experiences and to end their subordination. Given the hegemony of the West, these trends have had a strong influence on the women’s movement within India too. Hence, a serious study of the women’s movement must include an understanding of the various theoretical trends in the movement.</p>
<p>Feminist philosophers have been influenced by philosophers as diverse as Locke, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Derrida, Nietzsche, and Freud. Yet most of them have concluded that traditional philosophy is male-biased, its major concepts and theories, its self-understanding reveals ‘a distinctively masculine way of approaching the world’ (Alison Jagger). Hence, they have made efforts to transform traditional philosophy.</p>
<p>Keeping this background in mind we have undertaken to present some of the main philosophical trends among feminists. One point to take note of is that these various trends are not fixed and separate. Some feminists have opposed these categories. Some have changed their approach over time; some can be seen to have a mix of two or more trends. Yet, to develop an understanding, these broad trends can be useful. But before discussing the theories, we will begin with a very brief account of the development of the women’s movement in the West, especially the United States. This is necessary to understand the theoretical developments among feminists.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-the-womens-movement-in-the-west">Overview of the Women’s Movement in the West</h2>
<p>The women’s movement in the West is divided into two phases. The first phase arose in the mid-19th century and lasted until the 1920s, while the second phase began in the 1960s. The first phase is known for the suffragette movement or the movement of women for their political rights, i.e., the right to vote. The women’s movement arose in the context of the growth of capitalism and the spread of a democratic ideology. It arose in the context of other social movements that emerged at the time. In the U.S., the movements to free the black slaves and to organize the ever-increasing ranks of the proletariat were an important part of the socio-political ferment of the 19th century. In the 1830s and 1840s the abolitionists (those campaigning for the abolition of slavery) included some educated women who braved social opposition to the campaign to free the blacks from slavery. Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan Anthony, and Angeline Grimke were among the women active in the anti-slavery movement, who later also became active in the struggle for women’s political rights. But the opposition within the anti-slavery organizations to women representing them and to women in leadership forced them to think about their status in society and their rights. In the U.S., women in various states started getting together to demand their right to common education with men and for married women’s rights to property and divorce. The Seneca Falls Convention, organized by Stanton, Anthony, and others in 1848, proved to be a landmark in the history of the first phase of the women’s movement in the U.S. They adopted a Declaration of Sentiments modelled on the Declaration of Independence, in which they demanded equal rights in marriage, property, wages, and the vote. For 20 years after this convention, state-level conventions were held, and propaganda campaigns through lecture tours, pamphlets, and signature petitions were conducted. In 1868, an amendment was brought to the Constitution (the 14th Amendment) granting the right to vote to blacks but not to women. Stanton, Anthony, and others campaigned against this amendment but were unsuccessful in preventing it. A split between the women and the abolitionists took place.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the working class movement also grew, although the established trade union leadership was not interested in organizing women workers. Only the IWW supported the efforts to organize women workers who worked long hours for extremely low wages. Thousands of women worked in the garment industry. The Anarchists, Socialists, and the Marxists, some of whom were women, worked among the workers and organized them. Among them were Emma Goldman, Ella Reeve Bloor, Mother Jones, and Sojourner Truth. In the 1880s, militant struggles and repression became the order of the day. Most of the suffragette leaders showed no interest in the exploitation of the workers and did not support their movement. Towards the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the working class women’s movement developed rapidly. The high point of this was the strike of almost 40,000 women garment workers in 1909. The socialist women were very active in Europe and leading communists like Eleanor Marx, Clara Zetkin, Alexandra Kollantai, and Vera Zasulich were at the forefront of the struggle to organize working women. Thousands of working women were organized and women’s papers and magazines were published. It was at the Second International Conference of Working Women in Copenhagen that Clara Zetkin, the German communist and famous leader of the international women’s movement, inspired by the struggle of American women workers, moved the resolution to commemorate 8 March as ‘Women’s Day’ at the international level.</p>
<p>By the end of the century, the women’s situation had undergone much change in the U.S. Although they still did not have the right to vote, in the fields of education, property rights, and employment they had made many gains. Hence, the demand for the vote gained respectability. The movement took a more conservative tum, separating the question of gaining the right to vote from all other social and political issues. Their main tactics were petitioning and lobbying with senators, etc. However, it became active in 1914 with the entry of Alice Paul who introduced the militant tactics of the British suffragettes, like picketing, hunger strikes, sit-ins, etc. Due to their active campaign and militant tactics the women won the right to vote in America in 1920.</p>
<p>The women’s struggle in Britain started later than the American movement but it took a more militant turn at the beginning of the 20th century with Emmeline Pankhurst, her daughters, and their supporters adopting militant tactics to draw attention to their demand, facing arrest several times to press their demand. They had formed the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1903 when they got disillusioned with the style of work of the older organizations. The WSPU spearheaded the agitation for suffrage. But they compromised with the British government when the First World War broke out in 1914. Both in the U.S. and in England the leaders of the movement were white and middle class and restricted their demand to the middle class women. It was the socialists and communist women who rejected the demand for vote limited to those with property and broadened it to include voting rights for all women, including working class women. They organized separate mass mobilizations in support of the demand for the right to vote for women. The women’s movement did not continue during the period of the Depression, the rise of fascism, and the Second World War. In the post-Second World War period America saw a boom in its economy and the growth of the middle class. During the war years, women had taken up all sorts of jobs to run the economy but once the war was over they were encouraged to give up their jobs and become good housewives and mothers.</p>
<p>This balloon of prosperity and contentment lasted until the 1960s. Social unrest with the black civil rights movement gained ground and later the anti-war movement (against the Vietnam War) emerged. It was a period of great turmoil. The Cultural Revolution that began in China too had its impact. Political activity among university students increased and it is in this atmosphere of social and political turmoil that the women’s movement once again emerged, this time initially from among the university students and faculty. Women realized that they faced discrimination in employment, in wages and, overall, in the way they were treated in society. The consumerist ideology also came under attack. Although Simone de Beauvoir had written <em>The Second Sex</em> in 1949 itself, its full impact was felt only now. Betty Friedan had written <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> in 1963. The book became extremely popular. She initiated the National Organization of Women in 1966 to fight against the discrimination women faced and to struggle for the Equal Rights Amendment. But the autonomous women’s movement (radical feminist movement) emerged from within the student movement that had leftist leanings. Black students in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) (which campaigned for civil rights for blacks) threw out the white men and women students at the Chicago Convention in 1968, on the grounds that only blacks would struggle for black liberation. Similarly, the idea that women’s liberation is women’s struggle gained ground.</p>
<p>In this context, women members of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) demanded that women’s liberation be a part of the national council in their June 1968 convention. But they were hissed and voted down. Many of these women walked out and formed the WRAP (Women’s Radical Action Project) in Chicago. Women within the New University Conference (NUC - a national-level body of university students, staff, and faculty who wanted a socialist America) formed a Women’s Caucus. Marlene Dixon and Naomi Weisstein from Chicago were leading members in this. Shulamith Firestone and Pamela Allen began similar activities in New York and formed the New York Radical Women (NYRW). All of them rejected the liberal view that changes in the law and an equal rights amendment would solve women’s oppression and believed that the entire structure of society has to be transformed. Hence they called themselves radical. They came to hold the opinion that mixed groups and parties (men and women) like the Socialist Party, SDS, and the New Left would not be able to take the struggle for women’s liberation forward and a women’s movement, autonomous from all parties, was needed. The NYRW’s first public action was the protest against the Miss America beauty contest which brought the fledgeling women’s movement into national prominence. A year later, the NYWR divided into the Redstockings and the WITCH (Women’s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell). The Redstockings issued their manifesto in 1969 and in this their position of radical feminism was clearly presented for the first time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…We identify the agents of our oppression as men. Male supremacy is the oldest, most basic form of domination. All other forms of exploitation and oppression (racism, capitalism, imperialism, etc.) are extensions of male supremacy: men dominate women, a few men dominate the rest…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>‘Sisterhood is Powerful’ and ‘The Personal is Political’ became their slogans which gained wide popularity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SDS issued its position paper on Women’s Liberation in December 1968. This was debated by women from various points of view. Kathy McAfee and Myrna Wood wrote Bread and Roses to signify that the struggle cannot be solely against the economic exploitation of capitalism (‘Bread’) but must also be against the psychological and social oppression that women faced (‘Roses’). These debates that were carried out in the various journals produced by the women’s groups that emerged in this period were taken seriously and influenced the course and trends within the women’s movement, not only in the U.S. but in other countries as well. The groups mainly took the form of small circles for consciousness-raising and non-hierarchal structure. In this way, the socialist feminist and the radical feminist trends within the women’s movement emerged. They raised questions and brought many aspects of women’s oppression out into the open. <em>It must be noted that all of these were following either the Trotskyite or Cuban socialisms.</em></p>
<p>During the later 1960s and early 1970s, in the U.S. and Western Europe, ‘different groups had different visions of revolution. There were feminist, black, anarchist, Marxist-Leninist and other versions of revolutionary politics, but the belief that revolution of one sort or another was round the comer cut across these divisions’ (Barbara Epstein). The socialist (Marxist) and radical feminists shared a vision about revolution. During this first period the feminists were grappling with Marxist theory and key concepts like production, reproduction, class consciousness, and labour. Both, the socialist feminists and the radical feminists, were trying to alter Marxist theory to incorporate a feminist understanding of the women’s position. But, after 1975, there was a shift. Systemic analysis (of capitalism and the entire social structure) was replaced or recast as cultural feminism.</p>
<p>Cultural feminism begins with the assumption that men and women are essentially different. It focuses on the cultural features of patriarchal oppression and primarily aims for reforms in this area. Unlike the radical and the socialist feminisms, it adamantly rejects any critique of capitalism and emphasizes patriarchy as the root of women’s oppression and veers towards separatism. In the late 1970s and 1980s, lesbian feminism emerged as one current within the feminist movement. At the same time, ‘women of colour’ (Black women, third world women in the advanced capitalist countries) raised criticism about the ongoing feminist movement and began to articulate their versions of feminism. Organizations among working class women for equal treatment at the workplace, child care, etc., also started growing. That the feminist movement had been restricted to white, middle class, educated women in advanced capitalist countries, and was focusing on issues primarily of their concern, had become obvious. This gave rise to global or multicultural feminism. In the third world countries women’s groups also became active, but all the issues were not necessarily ‘purely’ women’s issues. Violence against women has been a major issue, especially rape, but alongside there have been issues that emerged from exploitation due to colonialism and neo-colonialism, poverty and exploitation by landlords, peasant issues, displacement, apartheid, and many other such problems that were important in their own countries. In the early 1990s postmodernism became influential among feminists.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, right-wing conservative backlash against feminism grew, focusing its opposition to the feminist struggle for abortion rights. They also attacked feminism for destroying the family, emphasizing the importance of women’s role in the family. Yet, the feminist perspective spread wide as countless activist groups and social and cultural projects at the grassroots grew and continued to be active. Women’s studies too spread widely. Healthcare and environmental issues have been the focus of attention of many of these groups. Many leading feminists were absorbed in academic jobs. At the same time, many of the major organizations and caucuses have become large institutions that run with their own staff and are like any established bureaucratic institution. Activism declined. In the 1990s, the feminist movement has come to be known more from the activities of these organizations and the writings of feminists in the academic realm. ‘Feminism has become more an idea than a movement, and one that lacks the visionary quality it once had,’ wrote Barbara Epstein in the Monthly Review (May 2001). In the 1990s, the increasing gap between the economic condition of the working class and oppressed minorities and the middle classes, the continuing gender inequality, increasing violence against women, the onslaught of globalization and its impact on people, especially women in the third world, has Jed to a renewed interest in Marxism. At the same time the participation of women, especially young women, in a range of political movements, as is evident in the anti-globalization and anti-war movements, has shown that women are politically active.</p>
<p>With this brief overview of the development of the women’s movement in the West we will now analyze the propositions of the main theoretical trends within the feminist movement.</p>
<h2 id="liberal-feminism">Liberal Feminism</h2>
<p>Liberal feminist thought has enjoyed a long history in the 18th and 19th centuries, with thinkers like Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-97), Harriet Taylor Mill (1807-58), and Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815-1902) arguing for the rights of women based on the liberal philosophical understanding. The movement for equal rights to women, especially the struggle for the right to vote, was primarily based on liberal thought. Earlier liberal political philosophers, like John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau, who had argued for the rule of reason and the equality of all, did not include women in their understanding of those deserving of equality, particularly political equality. They failed to apply their liberal theory to the position of women in society.</p>
<p>The values of liberalism, including the core belief in the importance and autonomy of the individual, developed in the 17th century. It emerged with the development of capitalism in Europe in opposition to feudal patriarchal values based on inequality. It was the philosophy of the rising bourgeoisie. The feudal values were based on the belief of the inherent superiority of the elite — especially, the monarchs; the rest were subjects, subordinates. In opposition to these feudal values, liberal philosophy advanced a belief in the natural equality and freedom of human beings. It advocated a social and political structure that would recognize the equality of all individuals and provide them with an equality of opportunity. This philosophy was rigorously rational and secular as well as the most powerful and progressive formulation of the Enlightenment period. It was marked by intense individualism. Yet the famous l8th century liberal philosophers like Rousseau and Locke did not apply the same principles to the patriarchal family and the position of women within it. This was the ‘residual patriarchal bias of liberalism that applied only to men in the market’ (Zillah Eisenstein).</p>
<p>Mary Wollstonecraft belonged to that radical section of the intellectual aristocracy in England which supported the French and American Revolutions. She wrote <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em> in 1791 in response to Edmund Burke’s conservative interpretation of the significance of the French Revolution. In the booklet she argued against the feudal patriarchal notions about women’s natural dependence on men, that women were created to please men, and that they cannot be independent. Her book was highly influential even in America at that time. Wollstonecraft wrote before the rise of the women’s movement and her arguments were based on logic and rationality. Underlying Wollstonecraft’s analysis were the basic principles of the Enlightenment: the belief in the human capacity to reason and in the concepts of freedom and equality that preceded and accompanied the American and French Revolutions. She recognized reason as the only authority and argued that unless women were encouraged to develop their rational potential and to rely on their own judgment, the progress of all humanity would be retarded. She argued primarily in favour of women getting the same education as men so that they could also be pick up the qualities of rational thinking and as well as be provided with the opportunities for earning and leading an independent life. She strongly criticized Rousseau’s ideas on women’s education. According to her, Rousseau’s arguments that women’s education should be different from that of men had contributed to making women more artificial and weak characters. Rousseau’s logic was that women should be educated in a manner to impress upon them that obedience is the highest virtue. However, her arguments reflect the class limitations of her thinking. While she wrote that women from the ‘common classes’ displayed more virtue because they worked and were to some extent independent, she also believed that ‘the most respectable women [were, in fact,] the most oppressed.’</p>
<p>Harriet Taylor, also part of the bourgeois intellectual circles of London, and wife of the well known Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill, wrote <em>On the Enfranchisement of Women</em> in 1851 in support of the women’s movement just as it emerged in the U.S. Giving stark liberal arguments against the opponents of women’s rights and in favour of women having the same rights as men, she wrote, ‘We deny the right of any portion of the species to decide for another portion, or any individual for another individual, what is and what is not their ’proper sphere.’ The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to…’ Noting the significance of the fact that society had not extended equal rights to women, she wrote, ‘The world is very young, and has but just begun to cast off injustice. It is only now getting rid of Negro slavery… Can we wonder it has not yet done as much for women?’</p>
<p>The liberal basis of the women’s movement, as it emerged in the mid-19th century in the U.S., is clear in the Seneca Falls Declaration (1848). The declaration at this first national convention began thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next phase of the women’s movement in the late 1960s, among the leading proponents of liberal ideas were Betty Friedan, Bella Abzug, and Pat Schroeder. Friedan founded the National Organization of Women (NOW) in 1966. The liberal feminists emerged from among those who were working in women’s rights groups, government agencies, commissions, etc. Their initial concern was to get those laws amended which denied equality to women in the sphere of education, employment, etc. They also campaigned against social conventions that limited women’s opportunities on the basis of gender. But as these legal and educational barriers began to fall it became clear that the liberal strategy of changing the laws within the existing system was not enough to get women justice and freedom. They shifted their emphasis to struggling for the equality of conditions rather than mere equality of opportunity. This led to the demand that the state play a more active role in creating the conditions in which women could actually realize opportunities. The demands for child care, welfare, healthcare, unemployment wage, special schemes for the single mother, etc., have been taken up by the liberal feminists. The struggle for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) has also been Jed by this section among the feminists. Their work has been through national-level organizations and thus they have been noticed by the media as well. Liberal feminists like Zillah Eisenstein argue that liberalism has potential as a liberating ideology because working women can, through their life experiences, see the contradiction between liberal democracy as an ideology and capitalist patriarchy which denies them the equality promised by that ideology. But liberalism was not the influential trend within the movement in this phase.</p>
<h3 id="critique">Critique</h3>
<p>Liberalism, as a philosophy, emerged from the womb of the western feudal society with the struggle of the bourgeoisie to come to power. Hence, it included an attack on the feudal values of divinely ordained truth and hierarchy (social inequality). It stood for reason and equal rights for all individuals. But this philosophy was based on extreme individualism rather than collective effort. Hence, it promoted the approach that if formal, legal equality was given to all, then it was for the individuals to take advantage of the opportunities available and become successful in life. The question of class differences and their effect on the opportunities available to people was not taken into consideration. Initially, liberalism played a progressive role in breaking the feudal social and political institutions. But in the 19th century, after the growth of the working class and its movements, the limitations of liberal thinking came to the fore, for the bourgeoisie that had come to power did not extend the rights it professed to the poor and other oppressed sections (like women, or blacks in the U.S.). They had to struggle for their rights.</p>
<p>The women’s movement and the Black movement in that phase were able to demand their rights utilizing the arguments of the liberals. Women from the bourgeois classes were at the forefront of this movement and they did not extend the question of rights to the working classes, including working class women. Working class ideologies had emerged — various trends of socialism found support among the active sections of the working class. They began to question the very bourgeois socio-economic and political system and the limitations of liberal ideology with its emphasis on formal equality and individual freedom. In this phase liberalism lost its progressive role and we see that the main women’s organizations fighting for suffrage, both in the U.S. and in England, had a very narrow aim and became pro-imperialist and anti-working class. In the present phase, liberal feminists have had to go beyond the narrow confines of formal equality to campaign for positive collective rights like welfare measures for single mothers, prisoners, etc., and demand a welfare state.</p>
<p>Liberalism has the following weaknesses:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It focuses on individual rights rather than collective rights.</li>
<li>It is ahistorical. It does not have a comprehensive understanding of women’s role in history nor any analysis for the subordination of women.</li>
<li>It tends to be mechanical in its support for formal equality without a concrete understanding of the condition of different sections/classes of women and their specific problems. Hence, it was able to express the demands of the middle classes (white women from middle classes in the U.S. and upper class, upper caste women in India) but not those of women from various oppressed ethnic groups, castes, and the working, labouring classes.</li>
<li>It is restricted to changes in the law, educational and employment opportunities, welfare measures, etc., and does not question the economic and political structures of the society which give rise to patriarchal discrimination. Hence, it is reformist in its orientation, both in theory and in practice.</li>
<li>It believes that the state is neutral and can be made to intervene in favour of women when, in fact, the bourgeois state in the capitalist countries and the semi-colonial and semi-feudal Indian state are patriarchal and will not support women’s struggle for emancipation. The state is defending the interests of the ruling classes who benefit from the subordination and devalued status of women.</li>
<li>Since it focuses on changes in the law and state schemes for women, it has emphasized lobbying and petitioning as the means to achieve their demands. The liberal trend most often has restricted its activity to meetings and conventions and mobilizing petitions calling for changes. It has rarely mobilized the strength of the mass of women and is, in fact, afraid of the militant mobilization of poor women in large numbers.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="radical-feminism">Radical Feminism</h2>
<p>Within bourgeois feminism, in the first phase of the women’s movement in the 19th and early 20th centuries, liberalism was the dominant ideology. In the contemporary phase of the women’s movement, however, radical feminism has had a strong impact and in many ways, although diffused, several ideas and positions can be traced to the radical feminist argument. In contrast to the pragmatic approach taken by liberal feminism, radical feminism aimed to reshape society and restructure its institutions, which they saw as inherently patriarchal. Providing the core theory for modem feminism, radicals argued that women’s subservient role in society was too closely woven into the social fabric to be unravelled without a revolutionary revamping of society itself. They strove to supplant hierarchical and traditional power relationships, which they saw as reflecting a male bias, with non-hierarchical and anti-authoritarian approaches to politics and organization.</p>
<p>In the second phase of feminism, in the U.S., the radical feminists emerged from the social movements of the 1960s — the civil rights movement, the new left movement, and the anti-Vietnam war/peace movement. They were dissatisfied with the roles given to women in these movements and the way that the new left tackled the women’s question in its writings, theoretical and popular. At the same time, none of them wanted to preserve the existing system. Hence, in its initial phase, the writings were a debate with Marxism, an attempt to modify or rewrite Marxism. Later on, as the radical feminist movement became strong, Marxism was cast aside and the entire emphasis shifted to an analysis of the sex/gender system and patriarchy delinked from the exploitative capitalist system.</p>
<p>In this contemporary phase of feminism, attention was focused on the origins of women’s oppression, and many theoretical books were written trying to analyze the form of women’s oppression and tracing the roots of this oppression. Yet one thing that needs to be kept in mind is that in all their writing they kept only their own society in mind. Hence, all their criticism, description, and analysis deal with advanced capitalist societies, especially, the U.S. In 1970, Kate Millett published the book <em>Sexual Politics</em> in which she challenged the formal notion of politics and presented a broader view of power relationships, including the relationship between men and women in society. Kate Millett saw the relationships between men and women as those of power; the domination of men over women was a form of power in society. Hence, she titled her book <em>Sexual Politics</em>. Here she made the claim that ‘the personal was political,’ which became a popular slogan of the feminist movement. By ‘the personal is political’ what she meant was that the discontent individual women feel in their lives is not due to individual failings but due to the social system, which has kept women subordinated and oppresses them in so many ways. Her personal feelings are therefore political. She reversed the historical materialist understanding by asserting that the male-female relationship is a framework for all power relationships in society. This ‘social caste’ (dominant men and subordinated women) supersedes all other forms of inequality, whether racial, political, or economic. This is the primary human situation. The other systems of oppression will continue because they get both logical and emotional legitimacy from oppression in this primary situation. Patriarchy, according to her, was male control over the private and public world.</p>
<p>According to her, to eliminate patriarchy, men and women must eliminate gender, i.e., sexual status, role, and temperament, as they have been constructed under patriarchy. Patriarchal ideology exaggerates the biological differences between men and women to subordinate women. Millett advocated a new society, which would not be based on the sex/gender system and in which men and women would be equal. At the same time, she argued that we must proceed slowly, eliminating undesirable traits like obedience (among women) and arrogance (among men). Kate Millett’s book was very influential for a long time and is still considered to be a classic for modem radical feminist thinking.</p>
<p>Another early influential writer was Shulamith Firestone, who argued in her book <em>The Dialectic of Sex</em> (1970) that the origins of women’s subordination and man’s domination lay in the reproductive roles of men and women. In this book she rewrites Marx and Engels. Engels had written of historical materialism as: ’ that view of the course of history which seeks the ultimate cause and great moving power of all historical events in the economic development of society, in the changes of the modes of production and exchange, in the consequent division of society into distinct classes, and in the struggles of these classes against one another. Firestone rewrote this as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Historical materialism is that view of the course of history which seeks the ultimate cause and the great moving power of all historical events in the dialectic of sex: the division of society into two distinctly biological classes for procreative reproduction, and the struggles of these classes with one another; in the changes in the mode of marriage, reproduction and childcare created by these struggles; in the connected development of other physically differentiated classes (castes); and in the first division of labour based on sex which developed into the (economic-cultural) class system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firestone focused on reproduction instead of production as the moving force of history. Further, instead of identifying social causes for the women’s condition, she stressed biological reasons and made it the moving force in history.</p>
<p>The biological fact that women bear children is the material basis for women’s submission in society and it needs a biological and social revolution to effect human liberation. She too believed that the sex/gender difference needs to be eliminated and human beings must be androgynous. But she went further than Millett in the solution she advocated to end women’s oppression. She believed that unless women give up their reproductive role and no longer bear children and the basis of the existing family is changed it is not possible to completely liberate women. Hence, according to her, unless natural reproduction was replaced by artificial reproduction and the traditional biological family replaced by the ‘intentional’ family, biological divisions between the sexes would not be eliminated. The biological family is the family in which members are genetically connected (parents and children) while the intentional family, according to her, means a family chosen by friendship or convenience. She believed that if this change occurred, the various personality complexes that develop in present society would no longer exist. Others wrote about how, historically, the first social conflict was between men and women. Man, the hunter, was prone to violence and he subjugated women through rape (Susan Brownmiller).</p>
<p>These writings set the tone for the women’s movement, the more radical section of it, which was not satisfied with the efforts of liberal feminists to change laws and campaign on such issues. They gave the push to delve into women’s traditional, hitherto taken for granted, reproductive role, gender/sex differences, and to question the very structure of society as being patriarchal, hierarchical, and oppressive. They called for a total transformation of society. Hence, radical feminists perceive themselves as revolutionary rather than reformist. Their fundamental point is that the sex/gender system is the cause of women’s oppression.</p>
<p>They considered the man-woman relationship in isolation from the rest of the social system, as a fundamental contradiction. As a result, their entire orientation and direction of their analysis and action deals primarily with this contradiction, taking them towards separatism. Since they focus on the reproductive role of women; they make sexual relations and family relations the central targets of their attack to transform society.</p>
<h3 id="sexgender-system-and-patriarchy">Sex/Gender System and Patriarchy</h3>
<p>The central point in the radical feminist understanding is the sex/ gender system. According to a popular definition given by Gayle Rubin, the sex/gender system is a ‘set of arrangements by which a society transforms biological sexuality into products of human activity.’ This means that patriarchal society uses certain facts about male and female physiology (sex) as the basis for constructing a set of masculine and feminine identities and behaviour (gender) that serve to empower men and disempower women, that is, how a man should be and how a woman should be. This, according to them, is the ideological basis of women’s subordination. Society is somehow convinced that these culturally determined behaviour traits are ‘natural.’ Therefore, they hold that ‘normal’ behaviour depends on one’s ability to display the gender identities and behaviour that society links with one’s biological sex.</p>
<p>Initially, the radical feminists, for example, the Boston group or the Radical New York group, upheld Millet and Firestone’s views and focused on the ways in which the concept of femininity and the reproductive and sexual roles and responsibilities (child-rearing, etc.) serve to limit women’s development as full persons. As a solution, they advocated androgyny, so that rigid sex-defined roles would no longer remain. But later, in the late 1970s, one section of radical feminists rejected the goal of androgyny as they believed that it meant that women would learn some of the worst features of masculinity. Instead, they proposed that women affirm their ‘femininity’ and try to be more like women, i.e., emphasize women’s virtues such as interdependence, community, connection, sharing, emotion, body, trust, absence of hierarchy, nature, immanence, process, joy, peace and life.</p>
<p>From here onward, their entire focus became separatist, believing that women should relate only to women and should build a women’s culture and institutions. With this, their understanding of sexuality also changed and they started arguing that women should become lesbians. Thus, they supported monogamous lesbian relations as the best option for women. Politically, they became pacifists. Violence and aggression are masculine traits that should be rejected as they upheld that women arc naturally peace-loving and life-giving. By building alternative institutions they believed that they were bringing revolutionary change. They began building women’s clubs, making women’s films and other forms of a separate women’s culture. In their understanding, the revolutionary transformation of society would take place gradually. This stream is called the <em>cultural feminist</em> trend because they are completely concentrating on the culture of society. They are not relating culture to the political-economic structure of society. But this became the main trend of radical feminism and is intertwined with eco-feminism and also postmodernism. Among the well-known cultural feminists are Marilyn French and Mary Daly.</p>
<h3 id="sexuality-heterosexuality-and-lesbianism">Sexuality: Heterosexuality and Lesbianism</h3>
<p>Since man-woman relations are the fundamental contradiction for radical feminists they have paid a great deal of attention to the sexual relations between them. Sexuality is the arena where most of the discussions and debates of radical feminism have got concentrated. The stand of the Christian churches in the West, regarding various issues including sex and abortion, has been extremely conservative. This is more so in countries like the U.S., France, and Italy. Christian morality has defended sex only after marriage and opposed abortion. The radical feminist theorists confronted these questions head-on. At the same time they also exposed how, in a patriarchal society, within sexual relations (even after marriage), women often feel a sense of being dominated. It is in this background that the questions of sexual repression, compulsory heterosexuality, and homosexuality or sexual choice became issues of discussion and debate.</p>
<p>The radical feminists believe that in a patriarchal society, even in sexual relations and practices, male domination prevails. This has been termed as repression by the earlier radical feminist trend and as an ideology of sexual objectification by the cultural feminists. According to them, sex is viewed as bad, dangerous, and negative by society, and the only sex permitted to women and considered acceptable is marital heterosexual practice. (Heterosexuality means sexual relations between people of different sexes, i.e., between men and women.) There is pressure from the patriarchal society to be heterosexual and sexual minorities, (i.e., lesbians, transvestites, transsexuals, etc.) are considered as intolerable. Sexual pleasure, a powerful natural force, is controlled by the patriarchal society by separating the so-called good, normal, healthy sexual practice from the bad, unhealthy, illegitimate sexual practice.</p>
<p>But the two streams have very different understandings of sexuality, which also affects the demands that they make and the solutions they offer. According to the radical feminist trend, sexual repression is one of the cruellest and most irrational ways for the forces of civilization to control human behaviour. Permissiveness is in the best interests of women and men. On the contrary, the cultural feminists consider heterosexual sexual relations as characterized by an ideology of objectification in which men are masters/subjects and women are slaves/objects. ‘Heterosexualism has certain similarities to colonialism particularly in its maintenance through force when paternalism is rejected and in the portrayal of domination as natural and in the de-skilling of women’ (Sarah Lucia Hoagland). This is a form of male sexual violence against women. Hence, feminists should oppose any sexual practice that normalizes male sexual violence. According to them, women should reclaim control over their sexuality by developing concern with their own sexual priorities which differ from the priorities of men. Women want intimacy and care rather than performance. Hence, they advocated that women should reject heterosexual relations with men and become lesbians.</p>
<p>On the other hand, radicals like Gayle Rubin believed that women must seek their pleasure and not make rules. For the cultural feminists, heterosexuality is about male domination and female subordination and so tt sets the stage for pornography, prostitution, sexual harassment and woman-battering. Hence, they advocated that women should give up heterosexual relations and go into lesbian relations in which there is emotional involvement. Cultural feminists emphasized the need to develop the essential ‘femaleness’ of women. Lesbianism was pushed strongly within the women’s movement in the West in the early 1980s but it receded a few years later.</p>
<p>The solution offered by the cultural feminists to end the subordination of women is breaking up the sexual relationship between men and women, with women forming a separate class themselves. The first trend is advocating free sexual relations delinked from any emotional involvement, whether with men or with women. The solutions which they are promoting make an intimate human relationship into a commodity type of impersonal relationship. From here, it is one step to support pornography and prostitution. While cultural feminists strongly opposed pornography, the radicals did not agree that pornography had any adverse impact on the way men viewed women. Instead, they believed that pornography could be used to overcome sexual repression. Even on questions of reproductive technology, the two sides differed. While the radicals supported reproductive technology, the cultural feminists were opposed to it. The latter believed that women should not give up motherhood since this is the only power they have. They have been active in the ethical debates raised by reproductive technology, such as those regarding the rights of the surrogate or biological mother.</p>
<h3 id="critique-1">Critique</h3>
<p>From the account given above it is clear that the radical feminists have ‘stood Marxism on its head,’ so to speak. Although we will deal with Firestone’s arguments in the section on socialist feminists some points need to be mentioned. In their understanding of the material conditions they have taken the physical fact of reproduction and women’s biological role as the central point for their analysis and concluded that this is the main reason for women’s oppression. Marx had written that production and reproduction of life are the two prior conditions for human existence. Reproduction means both the reproduction of the person on a day to day basis and the reproduction of the human species. But reproduction of the species is something humans share with the animal kingdom. That could not be the basis for women’s oppression. For, in all the thousands of years that people Jived in the first stages of human existence, women were not subordinated to men. In fact, her reproductive role was celebrated and given importance because the survival of the species and the group depended on reproduction. The importance given to fertility and the fertility rituals surviving in most tribal societies are testimony to this fact.</p>
<p>Marxism understands that some material conditions had to arise due to which the position of women changed and they were subordinated. The significant change in material conditions came with the generation of considerable surplus production. How this surplus would be distributed is the point at which classes arose, the surplus being appropriated by a small (section of people) in the community. A woman’s role in reproduction, the cause of her earlier elevated status, now became a means of her enslavement. Which clan/extended family the children she bore belonged to became important and it is then that we find the emergence of the patriarchal family in which the woman was subordinated and her main role in society became that of begetting children for the family. Radical feminists have treated historical development and historical facts lightly and imposed their own understanding of the man-woman contradiction as the original and principal contradiction that has determined the course of actual history.</p>
<p>From this central point, the radical feminist analysis abandons history altogether, ignoring the political-economic structure and concentrating only on the social and cultural aspects of the advanced capitalist society and projecting the situation there as the universal human condition. This is another major weakness in their analysis and approach.</p>
<p>Since they have taken the man-woman relationship (sex/gender relationship) as the central contradiction in society, all their analysis proceeds from it and men become the main enemies of women. Since they do not have any concrete strategy to overthrow this society they shift their entire analysis to a critique of the various superstructural aspects — the culture, language, concepts and ethics — without concerning themselves with the fact of capitalism and the role it plays in sustaining this sex/gender relationship. Hence they ignore the need to include the overthrow of capitalism in their strategy for women’s liberation. While making extremely strong criticisms of patriarchal structure the solutions they offer are, in fact, reformist. They are focused on changing the roles and traits and the attitudes and the moral values and, thereby, creating an alternative culture. Practically, it implies that people can, to some extent, give up certain values, for instance, men can give up their aggressive traits by recognizing them as patriarchal, while women can try to be bolder and less dependent, but when the entire structure of society is patriarchal how far can these changes be brought about without an overthrow of the entire capitalist system is a question that they do not address at all. So it ends up turning into small groups trying to change their lifestyle, their interpersonal relations; a focus on the interpersonal rather than the entire system. Although they began by analyzing the entire system and wanting to change it, their line of analysis has taken them in reformist channels. Women’s liberation is not possible in this manner. The fault lies with the basic analysis itself.</p>
<p>The cultural feminists have gone one step further by emphasizing the essential differences between males and females and claiming that female traits and values (not feminine) are desirable. This argument gives the biological basis of male-female differences more importance than social upbringing. This is, in fact, a counter-productive argument because conservative forces in society have always used such arguments (called ‘biological determinism’) to justify domination over a section of the people. The slaves were slaves because they had those traits and they needed to be ruled because they could not look after themselves. Women are women and men are men and they are essentially different, thus social roles for women and men are also different. This is the argument given by reactionary conservative forces which are opposed to women’s liberation.</p>
<p>Hence, the basic argument they are putting forward has dangerous implications and can and will rebound on the struggle of women for change. Masculinity and femininity are constructs of a patriarchal society and we have to struggle to change these rigid constructs. But this struggle is linked to the overthrow of the entire exploitative society. In a society where patriarchal domination ceases to exist, how men and women will be, what kind of traits they will adopt is impossible for us to say. The traits that human beings will then adopt will align with the type of society that will exist, since there can be no human personality outside some social framework. Seeking this femaleness is like chasing a mirage that amounts to self-deception. By making heterosexuality as the core point in their criticism of the present system, they encouraged lesbian separatism and thus took the women’s movement to a dead end. Apart from forming small communities of lesbians and building an alternative culture they could not and have not been able to take one step forward to liberate the mass of women from the exploitation and oppression they suffer. It is impractical and unnatural to think that women can have a completely separate existence from men. The cultural feminists have completely given up the goal of building a better human society. This strategy is not appealing to the large mass of women. Objectively it became a diversion from building a broad movement for women’s liberation.</p>
<p>The radical trend, by supporting pornography and giving the abstract argument of free choice, has taken a reactionary turn providing justification and support to the sex tourism industry promoted by the imperialists which is subjecting millions of women from oppressed ethnic communities and from the Third World countries to sexual exploitation and untold suffering. While criticizing hypocritical and repressive sexual mores of the reactionary bourgeoisie and the Church, the radical trend has promoted an alternative which only further alienates human beings from each other and debases the most intimate of human relations. Separating sex from love and intimacy, human relations become mechanical and inhuman. Further, their arguments are in absolute isolation from the actual circumstances of women’s lives and their bitter experiences.</p>
<p>Maria Mies (1986) has made a critique of this whole trend which sums up the weakness of the approach:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The belief in education, cultural action, or even cultural revolution, as agents of change is a typical belief of the urban middle class. With regard to the women’s question it is based on the assumption that women’s oppression has nothing to do with basic material production relations… This assumption is found more among Western, particularly American, feminists who usually do not talk of capitalism. For many western feminists women’s oppression is rooted in the culture of patriarchal civilization. For them, therefore, feminism is largely a cultural movement, a new ideology, or a new consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cultural feminism dominated Western feminism and influenced feminist thinking in third world countries as well. It unites well with the postmodernist trend and has deflected the entire orientation of the women’s movement from being a struggle to change the material conditions of the life of women to an analysis of ‘representations’ and symbols. They have opposed the idea of women becoming a militant force because they emphasize the non-violent nature of the female. They are disregarding the role women have played in wars against tyranny throughout history. Women will and ought to continue to play an active part in just wars meant to end oppression and exploitation. Thus they will be active participants in the struggle for change.</p>
<p>Summing up we can see that the radical feminist trend has taken the women’s movement to a dead end by advocating separatism for women. The main weaknesses in their theory and approach are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Taking a philosophically idealist position by giving central importance to personality traits and cultural values rather than material conditions. Ignoring the material situation in the world completely and focusing only on cultural aspects.</li>
<li>Making the contradiction between men and women as the principal contradiction, thereby, justifying separatism.</li>
<li>Making a natural fact of reproduction as the reason for women’s subordination and rejecting socio-economic reasons for the social condition of oppression, thereby, strengthening the conservative argument that men and women are naturally different.</li>
<li>Making women’s and men’s natures immutable.</li>
<li>Ignoring the class differences among women and the needs and problems of poor women.</li>
<li>By propagating women’s nature as non-violent they are discouraging women from becoming fighters in the struggle for their own liberation and that of society.</li>
<li>Despite claiming to be radical, having completely reformist solutions which cannot take women’s liberation forward.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="anarcha-feminism">Anarcha-Feminism</h2>
<p>The feminist movement has been influenced by anarchism and the anarchists have considered the radical feminists closest to their ideas. Hence, the body of work called anarcha-feminism can be considered as being very much a part of the radical feminist movement. Anarchists consider all forms of government (state) authoritarian and private property as tyrannical. They envisage the creation of a society which would have no government, no hierarchy and no private property.</p>
<p>While the anarchist ideas of Bakunin, Kropotkin and other classical anarchists have been an influence, the famous American anarchist Emma Goldman has particularly been influential in the feminist movement. Emma Goldman, a Lithuanian by birth, migrated to the U.S. in 1885 and as a worker in various garment factories came into contact with anarchist and socialist ideas. She became an active agitator, speaker and campaigner for anarchist ideas. In the contemporary feminist movement the anarchists circulated Emma Goldman’s writings and her ideas have been influential. Anarcha-feminists agree that there is no one version of anarchism, but within the anarchist tradition they share a common understanding on: (1) the criticism of existing societies, focusing on relations of power and domination, (2) the vision of an alternate, egalitarian, non-authoritarian society, along with claims about how it could be organized, and (3) the strategy for moving from one to the other.</p>
<p>They envisaged a society in which human freedom would be ensured, but believe that human freedom and community go together; however, the communities must be structured in such a way that makes freedom possible. They believe that there should be no hierarchies or authority. Their vision is different from the Marxist and liberal tradition but is closest to what the radical feminists are struggling for, the practice they are engaged in. For the anarchists believe that means must be consistent with the aims, the process by which revolution is being brought about, the structures, must reflect the new society and relations that have to be created. Hence, the process and the form of organization are extremely important.</p>
<p>The anarchists are critical of Marxists because according to them revolutionaries are creating hierarchical organizations (the party) through which they want to bring about the change. According to them, once a hierarchy is created it is impossible for people at the top to relinquish their power. Hence, they believe that the process by which the change is sought to be brought about is equally important. ‘Within a hierarchical organization we cannot learn to act in non-authoritarian ways.’ Anarchists emphasize ‘propaganda by deed,’ by which they mean exemplary actions, which by positive example encourage others to also join. The anarcha-feminists give examples of groups that have created various community-based activities, like running a radio station or a food co-operative in the U.S., in which non-authoritarian ways of running the organization have been developed. They have given central emphasis to small groups without hierarchy and domination. But the functioning of such groups in practice, the hidden tyrannical leadership (Joreen) that gets created, has led to many criticisms. The problems encountered included hidden leadership, having ‘leaders’ imposed by the media, over-representation of middle class women with lots of time their hands, lack of task groups which women could join and hostility towards women who showed initiative or leadership.</p>
<p>When the communists raise the question that the centralized state, controlled by the imperialists, needs to be overthrown they admit that their efforts are small in nature and there is a need of coordinating and linking up with others. But they are not willing to consider the need for a centralized revolutionary organization to overthrow the state. Basically, according to their theory, the capitalist state is not to be overthrown, but, rather, has to be outgrown. (‘Against the pathological state structure, perhaps the best word is to outgrow rather than overthrow,’ from an anarcha-feminist manifesto — Siren 1971.)</p>
<p>From their analysis it is clear that they differ strongly from the revolutionary perspective. They do not believe in the overthrow of the bourgeois/imperialist state as the central question and prefer to spend their energy in forming small groups involved in co-operative activities. In the era of monopoly capitalism it is an illusion to think that such activities can expand and grow and gradually engulf the entire society. They will only be tolerated in a society with excess surplus, like the U.S., as an oddity, an exotic plant. Such groups tend to get co-opted by the system in this way. Radical feminists have found these ideas suitable for their views and have been very much influenced by anarchist ideas of organization or there has been a convergence of anarchist views of organization and the radical feminist views on the same.</p>
<p>Another aspect of anarcha-feminist ideas is their concern for ecology and we find that eco-feminism has also grown out of anarcha-feminist views. As it is, anarchists in the Western countries are active on the environmental question.</p>
<h2 id="eco-feminism">Eco-Feminism</h2>
<p>Eco-feminism also has close links with cultural feminism, although the eco-feminists prefer to distinguish themselves from the latter. The approach that cultural feminists like Mary Daly have taken in their writings comes close to the eco-feminist understanding. Ynestra King, Vandana Shiva and Maria Mies are among the well-known eco-feminists.</p>
<p>Cultural feminists have celebrated women’s identification with nature in art, poetry, music and communes. They identify women and nature against (male) culture. So, for example, they are active anti-militarists. They blame men for war and point out that masculine preoccupation is with death-defying deeds.</p>
<p><em>Eco-feminists recognize that socialist feminists have emphasized the economic and class aspects of women’s oppression but criticize them for 1gnonng the question of the domination of nature.</em></p>
<p>Eco-feminists hold that feminism and ecology are the revolts of nature against human domination. They demand that we re-think the relationship between humanity and the rest of nature including our natural, embodied selves. In eco-feminism nature is the central category of analysis — the interrelated domination of nature — psyche and sexuality, human and non-human oppression, and the crucial historical position of women in these. This is the starting point for eco-feminism according to Ynestra King. And, in practice, it has been seen, according to her, that women have been at the forefront of struggles to protect nature — the example of the Chipko Movement, in which village women clung onto trees to prevent the contractors from felling them in Tehri-Garhwal, proves this point.</p>
<p>There are many streams within eco-feminism. There are the spiritual eco-feminists who consider their spiritualism as main, while the worldly believe in active intervention to stop the destructive practices. They say that the nature-culture dichotomy must be dissolved and our oneness with nature brought out. Unless we all live more simply some of us won’t be able to live at all. According to them there is room for men too in this save the earth movement.</p>
<p>There is one stream among eco-feminists who are against the emphasis on the nature-women connection. Women must, according to them, minimize their socially constructed and ideologically reinforced special connection with nature. The present division of the world into male and female (culture and nature), with men for culture building and women for nature (child-rearing and childbearing) must be eliminated and oneness emphasized. Men must bring culture into nature and women should, in tum, take nature into culture. This view has been called social constructionist eco-feminism. Thinkers like Warren believe that it is wrong to link women to nature because both men and women are equally natural and cultural. Mies and Shiva combined insights from socialist feminism (the role of capitalist patriarchy) with insights from global feminists who believe that women have more to do with nature in their daily work around the world, as well as from postmodernism which criticizes capitalism’s tendency to homogenize the culture around the world. They believed that women around the world had enough similarity to struggle against capitalist patriarchies and the destruction it spawns. Taking examples of struggles by women against ecological destruction by industrial or military interests, to preserve the basis of life, they conclude that women will be at the forefront of the struggle to preserve the ecology. They advocate a subsistence perspective in which people must not produce more than that needed to satisfy human needs, and use nature only as much as needed, not to make money but to satisfy community needs. Also, men and women should cultivate traditional feminine virtues (caring, compassion, nurturance) and engage in subsistence production, for only such a society can ‘<em>afford to live in peace with nature and uphold peace between nations, generations, and men and women</em>.’</p>
<p>Eco-feminists believe that women are non-violent by nature. Some of them are considered as transformative eco-feminists.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the theoretical basis for Vandana Shiva’s argument in favour of subsistence agriculture is actually reactionary. She makes a trenchant criticism of the green revolution and its impact as a whole, but from the perspective that it is a form of ‘western patriarchal violence’ against women and nature. She counterposes patriarchal western, rational/science with non-western wisdom. One can agree with her view that the imperialists used the developments in agricultural science to force the peasantry to increase their production (to avoid a Red revolution) and to become tied to the multinational corporation-sponsored market for agricultural inputs like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. But Shiva is rejecting agricultural science altogether and uncritically defending traditional practices. She claims that traditional Indian culture, with its dialectical unity of <em>Purusha</em> and <em>Prakriti</em>, was superior to the Western philosophical dualism of man and nature, man and culture, etc. Hence, she claims that in this civilization where production was for subsistence, to satisfy the vital basic needs of people, women had a close connection with nature. The Green Revolution broke this link between women and nature. In actual fact, what Shiva is glorifying is the petty pre-capitalist peasant economy with its feudal structures and extreme inequalities. In this economy, women toiled for long hours in backbreaking labour with no recognition of their work. She does not take into account the condition of Dalit and other lower caste women who toiled in the fields and houses of the feudal landlords of that time, abused, sexually exploited and unpaid most of the time.</p>
<p>Further, the subsistence life was not based on enough for all. In fact, women were deprived of even the basic necessities in this glorified pre-capitalist period and had no claim over the means of production; they were not independent either. This lack of independence is interpreted by her and Mies as the Third World women’s rejection of self-determination and autonomy for they valued their connection with the community. However, what women value as support structures when they do not have any alternative before them is being mistakenly projected as a conscious rejection of self-determination by Shiva. In effect, they are upholding the patriarchal pre-capitalist subsistence economy in the name of eco-feminism and also that of opposing western science and technology. A false dichotomy has been created between science and tradition. This is the form of culturalism or postmodernism that is involved in defending the traditional patriarchal cultures of third world societies and opposing development of the basic masses in the name of attacking the development paradigm of capitalism. We are opposed to the destructive and indiscriminate push given by profit-hungry imperialist agricultural businesses to agricultural technology (including genetically modified seeds, etc.) but we are not against the application of science and agricultural technology to improving agricultural production. Under the present class relations even science is the handmaiden of the imperialists but under a new democratic/socialist rule this will not be so. It is important to retain what is positive in our tradition, but to unthinkingly glorify it all is anti-people.</p>
<p>Eco-feminists idealize the relationship of women with nature and also lack a class perspective. Women from the upper classes, whether in advanced capitalist countries or the backward countries like India, hardly show any sensitivity to nature, so absorbed are they in the global, consumerist culture encouraged by imperialism. They do not think that imperialism is a worldwide system of exploitation. They have shown no willingness to change their privileges and basic lifestyles to reduce the destruction of the environment. For peasant women, the destruction of the ecology has led to untold hardships in carrying out the daily chores such as the procurement of fuel, water, fodder for cattle, etc. Displacement due to the takeover of their forests and lands for big projects also affects them badly. Hence, these aspects can and have become rallying points for mobilizing them in struggles. But from this we cannot conclude that women, as against men, have a ‘natural’ tendency to preserve nature. The struggle against monopoly capitalism, that is relentlessly destroying nature, is a political struggle, a people’s issue, in which the toiling people as a whole, men and women, must participate. And although the eco-feminists quote the Chipko struggle, in fact, there are so many other struggles in our country in which both men and women have agitated on what can be considered as ecological issues and their rights. The Narmada agitation, the agitation of villagers in Orissa against major mining projects, and against uranium mining and nuclear missile projects, or the struggle of tribals in Bastar and Jharkhand against the destruction of forests and major steel projects are examples of this.</p>
<h2 id="socialist-feminism">Socialist Feminism</h2>
<p>Socialist or Marxist women who were active in the new left, anti-Vietnam War student movement of the 1960s joined the women’s liberation movement as it spontaneously emerged. Influenced by the feminist arguments raised within the movement they raised questions about their role within the broad democratic movement, and the analysis on the women’s question being put forward by the New Left (essentially, a Trotskyite, revisionist leftist trend critical of the Soviet Union and China) of which they were a part. Although they were critical of the socialists and communists for ignoring the women’s question, unlike the radical feminist trend, they did not break with the socialist movement but concentrated their efforts on combining Marxism with radical feminist ideas. There is a wide spectrum amongst them as well. At one end of it are a section called Marxist feminists, who differentiate themselves from socialist feminists because they adhere more closely to Marx, Engels, and Lenin’s writings and have concentrated their analysis on women’s exploitation within the capitalist political economy. At the other end of the spectrum are those who have focused on how gender identity is created through child-rearing practices. They have focused on the psychological processes and are influenced by Freud. They are also called psycho-analytic feminists. The term feminist is used by all of them. Some feminists who are involved in serious study and political activity from the Marxist perspective also call themselves Marxist feminists to denote both their difference from socialist feminists and their seriousness about the woman’s question.</p>
<p>Marxist feminists like Mariarosa Dalla Costa and others from a feminist group in Italy did a theoretical analysis of housework under capitalism. Dalla Costa argued in detail that through domestic work women are reproducing the worker, a commodity. Hence, according to them, it is wrong to consider that only use values are created through domestic work. Domestic work also produces exchange values — the labour power. When the demand for wages for housework arose Dalla Costa supported it as a tactical move to make society realize the value of housework. Although most did not agree with their conclusion that housework creates surplus value and supported the demand for wages for housework, their analysis created a great deal of discussion in feminist and Marxist circles around the world and led to a heightened awareness of how housework serves capital. Most socialist feminists were critical of the demand but it was debated at length.</p>
<p>Initially, the question of housework (the early 1970s) was an important part of their discussion but by the 1980s it became clear that a large proportion of women were working outside the house or for some part of their lives they worked outside the house. By the early 1980s, 45% of the total workforce in the U.S. was female. Then their focus of study became the situation of women in the labour force in their countries. Socialist feminists have analyzed how women in the U.S. have been discriminated against in jobs and wages. The gender segregation in jobs, (concentration of women in certain types of jobs which are low wage), too, has been documented in detail by them. These studies have been useful to expose the patriarchal nature of capitalism. But for the purpose of this article, only the theoretical position regarding women’s oppression and capitalism that they take will be considered by us. We will present the position put forward by Heidi Hartmann in a much-circulated and debated article, ‘The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism: Towards a More Progressive Union’ to understand the basic <em>socialist feminist</em> position.</p>
<p>According to Heidi Hartmann, Marxism and feminism are two sets of systems of analysis which have been married but the marriage is an unhappy one because only Marxism, with its analytic power to analyze capital, is dominating. But, according to her, while Marxism provides an analysis of historical development and capital it has not considered the relations of men and women. She says that these relations are also determined by a system — which is patriarchy — which the feminists have analyzed. Both historical materialist analysis of Marxism and patriarchy as a historical and social structure are necessary to understand the development of western capitalist society and the position of women within it, to understand how relations between men have been created and how patriarchy has shaped the course of capitalism.</p>
<p>She is critical of Marxism on the women’s question. Marxism has dealt with the question only in relation to the economic system. Women are viewed as workers, and Engels believed that the sexual division of labour would be destroyed if women came into production, and all aspects of women’s lives are studied only in relation to how it perpetuates the capitalist system. Even the study on housework dealt with the relation of women to capital but not to men. Although Marxists are aware of the sufferings of women they have focused on private property and capital as the source of women’s oppression. But according to her, early Marxists failed to take into account the difference in men’s and women’s experience of capitalism and considered patriarchy to be a leftover from the earlier period. Capital and private property do not oppress women as women; hence their abolition will not end women’s oppression.</p>
<p>Engels and other Marxists do not analyze the labour of women in the family properly. Who benefits from her labour in the house, she asks, and argues that not only the capitalists but the men who benefit as well. A materialist approach ought not to have ignored this crucial point. It follows that men have a material interest in perpetuating women’s subordination. Further, her analysis has held that although Marxism helps us to understand the capitalist production structure, its occupational structure and dominant ideology, its concepts like those of a reserve army, wage labourer, class are <em>gender-blind</em> because there is no analysis as to who will fill these empty places, that is, who will be the wage labourer, who will constitute the reserve army, etc. For capitalism, anyone, irrespective of gender, race, nationality can occupy these positions. This is where the ‘woman question suffers.’</p>
<p>Some feminists have analyzed women’s work using Marxist methodology but by adapting it. Juliet Mitchell, for example, has analyzed women’s work in the market, their work of reproduction, sexuality and child-rearing. According to her, the work in the marketplace is production, the rest is ideological. For Mitchell, patriarchy operates in the realm of reproduction, sexuality and child-rearing. She did a psychoanalytical study of how gender-based personalities are formed for men and women. According to Mitchell, ‘we are dealing with two autonomous areas: the economic mode of capitalism and the ideological mode of patriarchy…’ Hartmann disagrees with Mitchell because of how the latter views patriarchy as solely ideological and does not give it a material base.</p>
<p>According to her, the material base of patriarchy is the control of men over the labour power of women. They control it by denying access to women over society’s productive resources (denying her a job with a living wage) and restricting her sexuality. This control, according to her, operates not only within the family but also outside, at the workplace. At home she serves the husband and at work she serves the boss. Here it is important to note that Hartmann makes no distinction between men of the ruling classes and other men.</p>
<p>Hartmann concluded that there is no pure patriarchy and no pure capitalism. Production and reproduction are combined in a whole society in the way it is organized and hence we have what she calls patriarchal capitalism. According to her, there is a strong partnership between patriarchy and capitalism. Marxism, she feels, could not gauge the strength and flexibility of patriarchy and overestimated the strength of capital. Patriarchy has adapted itself to suit capitalism and capital is flexible when it encounters earlier modes of production and it has adapted them to suit its needs for the accumulation of capital. Women’s role in the labour market and their work at home are determined by the sexual division of labour and capitalism has utilized them to treat women as secondary workers and to divide the working class.</p>
<p>Some other socialist feminists do not agree with Hartmann’s position that two autonomous systems are operating, first, capitalism in the realm of production, and second, patriarchy in the realm of reproduction and ideology. They call this the dual systems theory. Iris Young, for example, believes that Hartmann’s dual system makes patriarchy some kind of a universal phenomenon which has existed before capitalism and in every known society. This makes it ahistorical and prone to cultural and racial bias. Iris Young and some other socialist feminists argue that there is only one system, that is, <em>capitalist patriarchy</em>. According to Young, the concept that can help to analyze this clearly is not class, because it is gender-blind, but the division of labour. She argues that the gender-based division of labour is central and fundamental to the structure of the relations of production.</p>
<p>Among the recently more influential socialist feminists are Maria Mies (she also has developed into an eco-feminist) who also focuses on the division of labour: ‘The hierarchical division of labour between men and women and its dynamics form an integral part of dominant production relations, i.e., class relations of a particular epoch and society and of the broader national and international divisions of labour.’</p>
<p>According to her, a materialist explanation requires us to analyze the nature of women’s and men’s interaction with nature and through it to build up their human or social nature. She is critical of Engels for not considering this aspect. Femaleness and maleness are defined in each historical epoch differently. Thus, in earlier, what she calls, ‘matristic’ societies, women were significant for they were productive — they were active producers of life. Under capitalist conditions, this has changed and they are housewives, empty of all creative and productive qualities. Women as producers of children and milk, as gatherers and agriculturists had a relation with nature which was different from that of men. Men related to nature through tools. Male supremacy came not from superior economic contribution but from the fact that they invented destructive tools through which they controlled women, nature and other men. Further, she adds that it was the pastoral economy in which patriarchal relations were established. Men learnt the role of the male in impregnation. Their monopoly over arms and this knowledge of the male role in reproduction led to changes in the division of labour. Women were no longer important as gatherers of food or as producers, but their role was to breed children. Thus, she concludes that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can attribute the asymmetric division of labour between men and women to this predatory mode of production, or rather appropriation, which is based on male monopoly over means of coercion, i.e., arms and direct violence by means of which permanent relations of exploitation and dominance between the sexes was created and maintained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In upholding this, the family, state and religion have played an important part. Although Mies says that we should reject biological determinism, she herself veers towards it.</p>
<p>Several of their proposals for social change, like those of radical feminists, are directed towards the transformation of man-woman relations and the responsibility of rearing children. The central concern of socialist feminists, according to her, is reproductive freedom. This means that women should have control over whether and when to have children. Reproductive freedom includes the right to safe birth control measures, the right to safe abortion, daycare centres, a decent wage that can help look after children, medical care and housing. It also includes the freedom of sexual choice, that is, the right to have children outside the socio-cultural norm (that children can only be brought up in a family of a woman with a man). Women outside such arrangements should also be allowed to have and bring up children. And child-rearing, in the long run, must be transformed from a woman’s task to that of men and women. Women should not suffer due to childlessness or due to compulsory motherhood.</p>
<p>But they recognize that to guarantee all of the above, the wage structure of society must change, women’s role must change, compulsory heterosexuality must end, the care of children must become a collective enterprise and all this is not possible within the capitalist system. The capitalist mode of production must be transformed, but not alone, both (mode of procreation) must be transformed together.</p>
<p>Among later writers, an important contribution has come from Gerda Lerner. In her book, <em>The Creation of Patriarchy</em>, she goes into a detailed explanation of the origins of patriarchy. She argues that it is a historical process that is not one moment in history, due, not to one cause, but a process that proceeded over 2500 years from about 3100 BC to 600 BC. She states that Engels, in his pioneering work, made major contributions to our understanding of women’s position in society and history. He defined the major theoretical questions for the next hundred years. He made propositions regarding the historicity of women’s subordination but was unable to substantiate his propositions. From her study of ancient societies and states she concludes that <em>it was the appropriation of women’s sexual and reproductive capacity by men that lies at the foundation of private property, it preceded private property</em>. The first states (Mesopotamia and Egypt) were organized in the form of a patriarchy. Ancient Jaw codes institutionalized women’s sexual subordination (men’s control over the family) and slavery and they were enforced with the power of the state. This was done through force, the economic dependency of women, and class privileges to women of the upper classes. Through her study of Mesopotamia and other ancient states she traces how ideas, symbols and metaphors were developed through which patriarchal sex/gender relations were incorporated into Western civilization. Men learnt how to dominate other societies by dominating their own women. But women continued to play an important role as priestesses, healers, etc., as seen in goddess worship. And it was only later that women’s devaluation in religion also took place.</p>
<p>Socialist feminists use terms like mechanical Marxists, traditional Marxists and economistic Marxists for those who uphold the Marxist theory concentrating on the study and analysis of the capitalist economy and politics and differentiate themselves from them. They are criticizing all Marxists for not considering the fight against women’s oppression as the <em>central</em> aspect of the struggle against capitalism. According to them, the work of organizing women (feminist organizing projects) should be considered as socialist political work and socialist political activity must have a feminist side to it.</p>
<h3 id="socialist-feminist-strategy-for-womens-liberation">Socialist-Feminist Strategy for Women’s Liberation</h3>
<p>After tracing the history of the relationship between the left movement and the feminist movement in the U.S., a history where they have walked separately, Hartmann strongly feels that the struggle against capitalism cannot be successful unless feminist issues are also taken up. She puts forward a strategy in which she says that the struggle for socialism must be an alliance with groups with different interests (e.g., women’s interests are different from general working class interests) and, secondly, she says that women must not trust men to liberate them after revolution. They must have their own separate organizations and their own power base. Young too supports the formation of autonomous women’s groups but thinks that there are no issues concerning women that do not involve an attack on capitalism as well.</p>
<p>As far as her strategy is concerned, there is no need for a vanguard party to make revolution successful and women’s groups must be independent of the socialist organization. Jagger puts this clearly when she writes that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of socialist feminism is to overthrow the whole social order of what some call capitalist patriarchy in which women suffer alienation in every aspect of their lives. The socialist feminist strategy is to support some “mixed” socialist organisations. But also form independent women’s groups and ultimately an independent women’s movement committed with equal dedication to the destruction of capitalism and the destruction of male dominance. The women’s movement will join in coalitions with other revolutionary movements, but it will not give up its organizational independence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They have taken up agitations and propaganda on anti-capitalist issues and against male domination. Since they identify the mode of reproduction (procreation, etc.) as the base for the oppression of women, they have included it in the Marxist concept of the base of society. So they believe that many of the issues being taken up, like the struggle against rape, sexual harassment, and for free abortion, are both anti-capitalist and a challenge to male domination. They have supported the efforts for developing a women’s culture which encourages the collective spirit. They also support the efforts to build alternative institutions, like healthcare facilities and encourage community living or some form of a midway arrangement. In this they are close to radical feminists. But unlike radical feminists whose aim is that these facilities should enable women to move away from patriarchal, white culture into their own haven, socialist feminists do not believe such a retreat is possible within the framework of capitalism. In short, socialist feminists see it as a means of organizing and helping women, while radical feminists see it as a goal of completely separating from men.</p>
<p>Socialist feminists, like radical feminists, believe that efforts to change the family structure, which is what they call the cornerstone of women’s oppression, must start now. Thus, they have been encouraging community living, or some sort of midway arrangements where people try to overcome the gender division in work sharing, looking after children, and lesbians and heterosexual people can live together. Although they are aware that this is only partial, and success cannot be achieved within a capitalist society, they believe it is important to make the effort. Radical feminists assert that such arrangements are ‘living in revolution.’ That means this act is revolutionary itself. Socialist feminists are aware that transformation will not come slowly, that there will be periods of upheaval, but these are preparations. This is their priority.</p>
<p>Both radical feminists and socialist feminists have come under strong attack from black women for essentially ignoring their situation and concentrating all their analysis on the situation of white, middle class women and theorizing from it. For example, Joseph points out the condition of black slave women who were never considered ‘feminine.’ In the fields and plantations, in labour and in punishment, they were treated equally to men. The black family could never stabilize under conditions of slavery and black men were hardly in a condition to dominate their women, slaves that they were. Also, later on, black women have had to work for their Jiving and many of them have been domestic servants in rich white houses. The harassment they faced there, the long hours of work make their experience very different from that of white women. Hence, they are not in agreement with the concept of the family being the source of oppression (for blacks, it was, instead, a source of resistance to racism), on the dependence of women on men (black women can hardly be dependent on black men given the high rates of unemployment among them) and the reproduction role of women (they reproduced white labour and children through their domestic employment in white houses). Racism is an all-pervasive situation for them and this brings them in alliance with black men rather than with white women. Further, white women themselves have been involved in perpetuating racism, about which feminists should introspect, she argues. Initially, black women hardly participated in the feminist movement, although in the 1980s slowly a black feminist movement has developed which is trying to combine the struggle against male domination with the struggle against racism and capitalism.</p>
<p>These and similar criticisms from women of other third world countries has given rise to a trend within feminism called global feminism. In this context, postmodernism has also gained a following among feminists.</p>
<h3 id="critique-2">Critique</h3>
<p>Basically, if we see the main theoretical writings of socialist feminists we can see that they are trying to combine Marxist theory with radical feminist theory and their emphasis is on proving that women’s oppression is the central and moving force in the struggle within society. The theoretical writings have come predominantly from Europe and the U.S. and are focused on the situation in advanced capitalist society. All their analysis is related to capitalism in those countries. Even their understanding of Marxism is limited to the study of dialectics of a capitalist economy. There is a tendency to universalize the experience and structure of advanced capitalist countries to the whole world. For example, in South Asia and China, which have had a long feudal period, we see that women’s oppression in that period was much more severe.</p>
<p>The Maoist perspective on the women’s question in India also identifies patriarchy as an institution that has been the cause of women’s oppression throughout class society. But it does not identify it as a separate system with its own laws of motion. The understanding is that patriarchy takes different content and forms in different societies depending on their level of development and the specific history and condition of that particular society; that it has been and is being used by the ruling classes to serve their interests. Hence, there is no separate enemy for patriarchy. The same ruling classes, whether imperialists, capitalists, or feudal, and the state that they control, are the enemies of women because they uphold and perpetuate the patriarchal family, gender discrimination and the patriarchal ideology within that society. They get the support of ordinary men undoubtedly who pick up the patriarchal ideas, which are the ideas of the ruling classes and oppress women. But the position of ordinary men and those of the ruling classes cannot be compared.</p>
<p>Socialist feminists, by emphasizing reproduction, are underplaying the importance of the role of women in social production. The crucial question is that without women having control over the means of production and over the means of producing necessities and wealth how can their subordination ever be ended? <em>This is not only an economic question, but also a question of power, a political question</em>. Although this can be considered in the context of the gender-based division of labour, in practice, the emphasis is on relations within the heterosexual family and the ideology of patriarchy. On the other hand, the Marxist perspective stresses on women’s role in social production and that their withdrawal from playing a significant role in social production has been the basis for their subordination in class society. So we are concerned with how the division of labour, relations to the means of production and labour itself in a particular society are organized to understand how the ruling classes exploited women and forced their subordination. Patriarchal norms and rules helped to intensify the exploitation of women and reduce the value of their labour.</p>
<p>Supporting the argument given by Firestone, socialist feminists are stressing on women’s role in reproduction to build their entire argument. They follow Engels in that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the materialist conception, the determining factor in history is, in the final instance, the production and reproduction of immediate life. This, again, is of a twofold character; on the one side, the production of the means of existence, of food, clothing and shelter and the tools necessary for that production; on the other side, the production of human beings themselves, the propagation of the species. The social organisation under which the people of a particular epoch live is determined by both kinds of production. (<em>Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on this quotation they make the point that in their analysis and study they only concentrated on production, while ignoring reproduction altogether. Engels’ quote gives the basic framework of a social formation. Historical materialism, om study of history, makes it clear that any one aspect cannot be isolated or even understood without taking the other into account. The fact is that throughout history women have played an important role in social production and to ignore this and assert that women’s role in the sphere of reproduction is the central aspect and it should be the main focus is, in fact, accepting the argument of the patriarchal ruling classes that women’s social role in reproduction is more important than anything else.</p>
<p>The socialist feminists also distort and render meaningless the concept of base and superstructure in their analysis. Firestone says that (and so do socialist feminists like Hartmann) reproduction is a part of the base. It follows from this that all social relations connected with it must be considered as part of the base — the family, other man-woman relations, etc. If all the economic, as well as reproductive relations, are part of the base, then the concept of the base becomes so broad that it loses its meaning altogether and cannot be an analytic tool as it is meant to be.</p>
<p>Gender-based division of labour has been a useful tool to analyze the patriarchal bias in the economic structure of particular societies. But the socialist feminists, who are putting forward the concept of the gender division of labour as being more useful than private property, are confusing the point, historically and analytically. The first division of labour was between men and women. And it was due to natural or biological causes — the role of women in bearing children. But this did not mean inequality between them — the domination of one sex over another. Women’s share in the survival of the group was very important — the food gathering they did, the discovery they made of growing and tending plants, the domestication of animals that was essential for the survival and advance of the group. At the same time, further division of labour took place which was not sex-based. The invention of new tools, knowledge of domesticating animals, of pottery, of metalwork, of agriculture, all these and more, contributed towards a more complex division of labour. All this has to be seen in the context of the overall society and its structure - the development of clan and kinship structures, of interaction and clashes with other groups and of control over the means of production that were being developed. With the generation of surplus, with wars and the subjugation of other groups who could then be made to labour, the process of the withdrawal of women from social production appears to have begun. Thus, the concentration of the means of production and the surplus in the hands of clan/tribe heads began which became manifest as male domination. Whether this control of the means of production remained communal in form, or it developed in the form of private property, whether by then class formation had taken place fully or not, was different for different societies. We have to study the particular facts of specific societies. Based on the information available in his time, Engels traced the process in Western Europe in ancient times; similarly, it is for us to trace this process in our own respective societies. The full-fledged institutionalization of patriarchy could only come later, that is, the defence of or the ideological justification for the withdrawal of women from social production and their role being limited to reproduction in monogamous relationships could only come after the full development of class society and the emergence of the state.</p>
<p>Hence, the mere fact of the gender division of labour does not explain the inequality. To assert that gender-based division of labour is the basis of women’s oppression rather than class still begs the question: if we do not find some social and material reasons for the inequality, then we are forced into accepting the argument that men have an innate drive for power and domination. Such an argument is self-defeating because it means that there is no point in struggling for equality. It can never be realized. The task of bearing children, by itself, cannot be the reason for this inequality, for as we have said earlier it was a role that was lauded and welcomed in primitive society. Other material reasons had to arise that was the cause, which the radical and socialist feminists are not probing.</p>
<p>In the realm of ideology, socialist feminists have done detailed analyses exposing the patriarchal culture in their society, for instance, the myth of motherhood. But the one-sided emphasis by some of them on ideological and psychological factors makes them lose sight of the wider socio-economic structure on which this ideology and psychology are based.</p>
<p>On the questions of organization, the socialist feminists are trailing the radical feminists and anarcha-feminists. They have clearly placed their strategy, but this is not a strategy for socialist revolution. It is a completely reformist strategy because it does not address the question of how socialism can be brought about. If, as they believe, socialist/communist parties should not do it, then the women’s groups should bring forth a strategy of how they will overthrow the rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie. They are restricting their practical activities to organizing small groups, building alternative communities, of general propaganda and mobilizing around specific demands. This is a form of economistic practice. These activities in themselves are useful to organize people at the basic level but they are not enough to overthrow capitalism and to take the process of women’s liberation ahead. This is a major organizing work in confrontation with the state — its intelligence and armed power. Socialist feminists have left this question aside, in a sense left it to the very revisionist and revolutionary parties that they criticize. Hence, their entire orientation is reformist, to undertake limited organizing and propaganda within the present system. A large number of the theoreticians of the radical feminist and socialist feminist trend have been absorbed in high paying, middle class jobs, especially in the universities and colleges and this is reflected in the elitism that has crept into their writing and the distance from the mass movement. It is also reflected in the realm of theory. One Marxist feminist states, ‘By the 1980s however, many socialist and Marxist feminists working in or near universities and colleges not only had been thoroughly integrated into the professional middle class but had also abandoned historical materialism’s class analysis…’</p>
<h2 id="postmodernism-and-feminism">Postmodernism and Feminism</h2>
<p>The criticism of feminists from non-white women led a section of feminists to move in the direction of multiculturalism and postmodernism.</p>
<p>Taking off from the existentialist writer Simone de Beauvoir that the woman is the ‘other,’ postmodernist feminists are glorifying the position of the Other because it is supposed to give insights into the dominant culture of which she is not a part. Women can therefore be critical of the norms, values and practices imposed on everyone by the dominant culture. They believe that studies should be oriented from the values of those who are being studied, the subalterns, who have been dominated. Postmodernism has been popular among academics. They believe that no fixed category exists, in this case, woman. The self is fragmented by various identities — by sex, class, caste, ethnic community and race. These various identities have a value in themselves. Thus, this becomes one form of <em>cultural relativism</em>. Hence, for example, in reality, no such category of ‘women’ exists. Woman can be one of the identities of the self, but there are others too. There will be a Dalit woman, a Dalit woman prostitute, an upper caste woman, and such like. Since each identity has a value in itself, no significance is given to values towards which all can strive. Looked at in this way there is no scope to find common ground for collective political activity. The concept of woman helped to bring women together and act collectively. But this kind of identity politics divides more than it unites. The unity is on the narrowest basis. Postmodernists celebrate <em>difference</em> and <em>identity</em> and they criticize Marxism for focusing on one ’ totality’ — class — and for being ‘essentialist.’</p>
<p>Further, postmodernism does not believe that language (western languages at least) reflects reality. They believe that identities are ‘constructed’ through ‘discourse.’ Thus, in their understanding, language constructs reality. Therefore, many of them have focused on ‘deconstruction’ of language. In effect, this leaves a person with nothing — there is no material reality about which we can be certain. This is a form of extreme subjectivism. Postmodernist feminists have focused on psychology and language. Postmodernism, in agreement with the famous French philosopher Foucault, is against what they call ‘relations of power.’ But this concept of power is diffused and not clearly defined. Who wields the power? According to Foucault, it is only at the local level, so resistance to power can only be local. Is this not the basis of NGO functioning which unites people against some local corrupt power and makes adjustments with the power above, the central and state governments. After all, postmodernism is sceptical of any ideology or ‘large projects’ or ‘grand narratives’ like humanism, enlightenment and Marxism and see the reality as fragmented ’ little narratives.’ In effect, postmodernism is extremely divisive because it promotes fragmentation between people and gives relative importance to identities without any theoretical framework to understand the historical reasons for identity formation and to link the various identities. So we can have a gathering of NGOs like World Social Forum, where everyone celebrates their identity — women, prostitutes, gays, lesbians, tribals, Dalits, etc., but there is no theory bringing them under an overall understanding, a common strategy. Each group will resist its own oppressors, as it perceives them. With such an argument, logically, there can be no organization; at best, it can be spontaneous organization at the local level and temporary coalitions.</p>
<p>To advocate organization according to their understanding means to reproduce power — hierarchy, oppression. Essentially, they leave the individual to resist for himself or herself, and are against consistent organized resistance and armed resistance. Carole Stabile (1997), a Marxist feminist has put it well when she says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti-organisational bias is part and parcel of the postmodernist package. To organize any but the most provisional and spontaneous coalitions is, for postmodernist social theorists and feminists alike, to reproduce oppression, hierarchies, and forms of intractable dominance. The fact that capitalism is extremely organized makes little difference, because one resists against a multivalent diffuse form of power. Nor, as Joreen pointed out over two decades ago, does it seem to matter that structurelessness produces its own forms of tyranny. Thus, in place of any organized politics, postmodernist social theory offers us variations on pluralism, individualism, individualized agency, and ultimately individualized solutions that have never — and will never — be capable of resolving structural problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not surprising that capitalism, imperialism, etc., do not mean anything more than one more form of power. While postmodernism in its developed form may not be found in a semifeudal, semi-colonial society like India, many bourgeois feminists have been influenced by it. Their vehement criticism of revolutionary and revisionist organizations on grounds of bureaucracy and hierarchy and the total disregard of class issues in the women’s movement also reflect the influence of postmodernism in recent times.</p>
<h2 id="summing-up">Summing Up</h2>
<p>We have presented in brief, the main theoretical trends in the feminist movements as they have developed in the West in the contemporary period. While the debate with Marxism, and within Marxism itself, dominated the 1970s, in the 1980s cultural feminism with its separatist agenda and focus on the cultural aspects of women’s oppression came to the fore. Issues of sexual choice and the reproductive role of women came to dominate the debate and discussions in feminist circles. Many socialist feminists have also given significance to these questions although not in the extreme form that cultural feminists have. The transformation of the heterosexual family became the main call of the bourgeois feminist movement and the more active sections among them tried to bring it into practice as well. Although many of them may have envisaged a change in the entire social system in this way; in fact, it became a reformist approach which they have tried to theorize. Postmodernism made its influence felt in the 1990s. Yet, in the late I990s, Marxism was again becoming an important theory within feminist analysis.</p>
<p>This critical overview of the way in which the feminist movement (particularly, the radical feminist and socialist feminist trends) theoretically analyzed women’s oppression, the solutions they have offered and the strategies they evolved to take the movement forward, shows us that flaws in their theory have led to advocating solutions which have taken the movement into a dead end. Despite the tremendous interest generated by the movement and the wide support from women who were seeking to understand their own dissatisfactions and problems, the movement could not develop into a consistent broad-based movement including not only the middle classes but also women from the working class and ethnically oppressed sections. The main weaknesses in their theory and strategies were:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Seeking roots of women’s oppression in their reproductive role. Since women’s role in reproduction is determined by biology, it is something that cannot be changed. Instead of determining the material, social causes for the origin of women’s oppression they instead focused on a biologically-given factor thereby falling into the trap of biological determinism.</li>
<li>Concerning her biological role, focusing on the patriarchal nuclear family as the basic structure in society in which her oppression is rooted. Thus, their emphasis was on opposing the heterosexual family as the main basis of women’s oppression. As a result, the wider socioeconomic structure in which the family exists and which shapes the family was ignored.</li>
<li>Making the contradiction between men and women as the main contradiction. Concentrating their attention on changing the sex/gender system — the gender roles that men and women are trained to play. This meant concentrating on the cultural, psychological aspects of social life while ignoring the wider political and economic forces that give rise to and defend patriarchal culture.</li>
<li>Emphasizing the psychological/personality, differences between men and women as biological and advocating separatism for women. Overemphasis on sexual liberation for women: separate groups, separate live-in arrangements and lesbianism. essentially, this meant that this section of the women’s movement confined itself to small groups and could not appeal to or mobilize the mass of women.</li>
<li>Falling into the trap of imperialism and its promotion of pornography, sex tourism, etc., by emphasizing the need for liberating women from sexual repression. Or, in the name of equal opportunities, supporting women’s recruitment into the U.S. Army before the Iraq War (2003).</li>
<li>Organizational emphasis on opposition to hierarchy and domination and focus on small consciousness-raising groups and alternative activity, which is self-determined. Opposing the mobilization and organizing of large mass of oppressed women.</li>
<li>Ignoring or being biased against the contributions made by the socialist movements and socialist revolutions in Russia, China, etc., in bringing about a change in the condition of large sections of women.</li>
</ol>
<p>How incorrect theoretical analysis and wrong strategies can affect a movement can be clearly seen in the case of the feminist movement. Not understanding women’s oppression as linked to the wider exploitative socio-economic and political structure, to imperialism, they have sought solutions within the imperialist system itself. These solutions have at best benefited a section of middle class women but left the vast mass of oppressed and exploited women far from liberation. The struggle for women’s liberation cannot be successful in isolation from the struggle to overthrow the imperialist system itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-womens-movement-in-india-in-light-of-these-philosophical-trends">The Women’s Movement in India In Light of These Philosophical Trends</h2>
<h3 id="liberalism-in-the-first-phase">Liberalism in the first phase</h3>
<p>In the colonial period, from the 19th century itself, liberal ideas came to influence sections of the intelligentsia in different parts of India, particularly, in Western India and in the South, which led to the emergence of the social reform movement. Naturally, the plight of women became one of the important issues around which they took up education and propaganda. But the specificity of the social conditions of India, in which the caste system has been an important institution of oppression and exploitation made the social reform movement also differentiated. Since most of them were drawn from the upper castes they took up issues primarily affecting women within the upper castes, like <em>sati</em>, <em>purdah</em>, child marriage and widow re-marriage. During the British period, initially, it was male social reformers like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, M.G. Ranade, Agarkar, Veerashivalingu, Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, Ram Mohan Roy and Keshab Chandra Sen, who were inspired by liberal philosophy in their campaign to improve the conditions of women. They advocated education for women. However, they did not advocate equal rights in all spheres but sought to ameliorate the more cruel customs like permanent widowhood.</p>
<p>At the same time, among the middle castes and the Untouchables too there was an awakening which led to the rise of intellectuals from amongst them. The approach taken by Jyotiba Phule was much more democratic because he took up the question of caste oppression and linked the women’s question to the caste system. They demanded equal rights for all castes and women. Women social reformers of this earlier period like Tarabai Shinde, Pandita Ramabai, Savitribai Phule, Ramabai Ranade and Muthulaxmi Reddy also took a more democratic stand challenging women’s subordination within religion and within the family. They strove to spread education among women, help women in distress, and take up employment. Yet their activity remained basically within the framework of social reform.</p>
<p>In the Indian context, since the battle against feudal customs and values took place under a colonial regime, with the partial support of the same colonial power which supported feudal classes, it could not take on a thoroughgoing democratic approach. Further, the main bourgeois and petty-bourgeois forces leading the reform movement themselves were not in favour of breaking the feudal structure from its roots. We find that liberal ideology was adopted in its narrowest sense. In the post-1947 period, India has still not seen a total democratic transformation, due to which women are still not accepted as independent beings with equal rights. Anomalies in the laws deny women equal rights; oppressive feudal customs like <em>purdah</em> and <em>sati</em> continue, and it is possible only for women from upper and middle classes to be active on issues of discrimination against women and for women’s rights with a liberal outlook.</p>
<p>When the masses were mobilized into the anti-British movement after the First World War, women too started getting mobilized for their demands. Thus, the women’s movement emerged from within the anti-British movement. The upper sections of this movement were inspired by liberal ideas. Organizations like the All-India Women’s Conference (AIWC) and the Anjuman-e-Khawateen-e-Islam were gatherings of women from the upper and middle classes and they campaigned and petitioned for women’s rights to property, for rights within marriage, and for the right to vote, etc. They did not question the social structure or link the question of women’s secondary status to the wider social structure. Their emphasis was on gaining rights for women through the law. In the present period, the philosophy of liberalism governs the functioning of established women’s organizations and forums like the National Commission of Women, the Gandhian women’s organizations like SEWA and of those their leaders like Ila Bhatt.</p>
<h3 id="the-second-contemporary-phase">The Second, Contemporary Phase</h3>
<p>Women from the toiling classes like workers, peasants, and students also came to be mobilized in large numbers under the influence of socialist and Marxist ideology. They actively participated in struggles against landlord oppression and the British. Women’s organizations, with membership in the hundreds of thousands, were set up in many parts of the country, especially, in Bengal, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh. In the first phase of the women’s movement in India in the first part of the 20th century both liberal and Marxist trends were influential among women.</p>
<p>In the second phase, from the 1970s onwards, the situation became more complex and influences much more varied. The mobilization of the masses of women took place on issues that emerged from the contradictions that racked Indian society — unemployment, price rise, corruption and continued severe exploitation of the rural poor peasants and landless, tribal and non-tribal, by landlords. Women were mobilized under the leadership of the Naxalites, socialists and the revisionist parties like the Communist Party and the Communist Party (Marxist). The main leadership of the independent urban women’s groups that emerged in the mid-1970s came from among educated women who had been active in various Left (revisionist, revolutionary and independent) groups or parties. They were influenced by the women’s movement in the West and the debates that cropped up there. The issue of violence on women — rape, dowry deaths, <em>sati</em>, eve teasing, sexist portrayal of women in the media, and domestic violence — all came to be focused upon by the urban women’s movement. These groups, the individual members and their activities, initially got support from the mass media and, hence, their impact was widespread.</p>
<p>The urban women’s movement emerged spontaneously, independent of any political party. Under the impact of the western women’s movement the groups also stressed the importance of being autonomous from political parties. The predominant influence on the autonomous women’s movement was that of socialist feminism. The activities and thinking of these groups and individuals have also undergone much change over the past 25 years. They have responded differently to the responses to the various campaigns undertaken by them. The growth of the right-wing parties and organizations, particularly, the BJP, VHP, and the Bajrang Dal has affected the urban women’s movement. The mobilization of large numbers of women by these groups in support of the <em>sati</em>, in the campaign to demolish the Bahri Masjid, and even in support of the pogroms against Muslims in Gujarat made the women’s movement realize that merely sisterhood cannot unite all women. The nature of activities undertaken by the urban groups changed towards the end of the 1980s with less focus on propaganda among and mobilization of the mass of women, and more emphasis on documentation, influencing the media, lobbying for changes in laws, etc., helping women in distress. The impact of socialist feminism is much wider than these groups because it has diffused among women and men in the academic community, and broader sections of women intellectuals.</p>
<p>The impact of socialist feminism can be clearly seen in the manner in which issues are taken up. The focus of these groups has been on patriarchy, particularly violence within the family, and they are suspicious of all organized politics, including revolutionary parties. But they have consistently opposed right-wing politics and exposed its anti-women character through their writings and research. They have also played an important role in bringing out the brutality of these parties and the state in riots and pogroms and their impact on women, whether the anti-Sikh riots in Delhi in 1984 or the Gujarat killings in 2002. But they have not played as significant a role in supporting the many mass movements that have emerged in the past two decades in the rural areas in which women have played an active role and have also suffered severe state repression. The pacifism that was promoted by cultural feminists is influential among feminists (including non-Gandhians) and hence we find a large section of them opposed to militant forms of struggle and against the armed struggle of the oppressed.</p>
<p>Gail Omvedt has been an important writer in India who has theorized on the women’s question within the broad framework of socialist feminism. Unlike most other feminists, Gail Omvedt has always given importance to mass movements and especially the rural women’s movement (<em>We Will Smash This Prison</em>) and her writings have been given importance by those who are striving for revolution. In her widely-read booklet, <em>Violence against Women, New Movements and New Theories</em>, written in 1990 and reprinted in 2000, she has focused on three new theories — the analysis and program given by Shetkari Sanghatana led by Sharad Joshi, the analysis by Sharad Patil and Vandana Shiva’s analysis and support for the Chipko movement. She considers them as organic intellectuals who have made significant contributions to the women’s cause in India. Sharad Joshi initiated massive mobilization of peasant women from 1987 to 1990 under the banner of the Shetkari Mahila Agadhi (Peasant Women’s Front) in Maharashtra and pushed for women’s active participation in local elections to panchayats and zilla parishads. Sharad Patil, formerly a CP(M) district leader, did a detailed study based on ancient texts into the origins of caste in India — <em>Dasa Shudra Slavery</em>, and within that traced the emergence of women’s oppression. He believed that Marxism alone cannot adequately analyze Indian history and the specificity of caste requires us to also adopt the theoretical approach developed by Phule and Ambedkar. (He has recently repudiated this theoretical fusion.) Vandana Shiva’s eco-feminist views have also been analyzed by her. Having presented their basic points and their strengths and weaknesses, she points out that all of them give significance to the role of violence in subjugating women as against the ‘traditional Marxist’ explanation which deals only with economic causes like the production of surplus and the rise of private property.</p>
<p>Gail Omvedt then goes on to give her analysis of the origins of women’s oppression. Omvedt believes that Engels’ analysis oversimplified the origins of the oppression of women as emerging with the development of class society with private property and the state. According to her, we ‘reject the simplifications of the traditional Marxist tendency to see violence as only an epiphenomena… and have to throw out the interpretation of “class” and “class struggle” in terms of private property and the centrality of a factory-based largely male proletariat…’ She also rejects the simplification of radical feminism that male domination was associated with hunting as the earliest form of exploitation and violence.</p>
<p>According to her, historically, although settled agricultural societies appeared from about 10000-8000 BC and there was production of surplus, yet, for a long period there was no evidence of violence, class exploitation or patriarchal domination. She follows Gerda Lerner’s study that patriarchal domination is visible with the rise of the first states (3000 BC). But she says that there is no evidence that private property or ownership of land preceded the formation of these states, there is no separate land-owning or slave-owning class whose power is based on the ownership of property. She believes that these earliest states were close to the Asiatic mode of production and there was a ‘state class’ which extracted surplus from the peasantry which was still not differentiated into classes. Classes emerged later, and Engels’ analysis fits the states that appeared almost 2000 years later in Greece, Rome and Magadha (Bihar). From this she concludes that the ‘overall historical and archaeological evidence backs up the stress on the autonomous role of force and violence found in Shetkari Sangathana’s theory and other recent theories.’ In that ancient period the organized and legitimated violence of the state was central to the development of looting, economic exploitation and patriarchy. Then she goes on to add that it is also important in the Indian context to incorporate the role of caste in the development of state domination, exploitation and patriarchy. Further, in current capitalism and imperialism, and their link to ecological destruction, there is a need to include the concerns of eco-feminists.</p>
<p>Finally, Omvedt adds that the dialectics of sex, the insights of radical feminists too need to be incorporated in a holistic analysis. Thus, according to her, the question of women’s oppression is related to basic conditions that include the control of property and means of production, control over political power and the means of violence, control over their own bodies and the means of reproduction,’ and all these have appeared on the agenda of the women’s movement at present. The traditional left and urban feminists are not tackling any of these questions properly and each of them is being taken up by different movements. She believes that old theories, ideas and conventional methods are being challenged. Also, according to her, <em>the liberation struggle is not simply one of mobilizing an army to capture state power and establish the socialist society, but of changing individuals as much as transforming the collective movements against exploitation themselves</em>. This is being done, not by the old left or the urban feminists but by movements that are emerging from the depths of the exploitative and destructive social order, the movements of the peasants, Dalits and Adivasis.</p>
<p>Omvedt’s perspective, while bringing out some important points on what the women’s movement needs to take up, is, in fact, reformist rather than transformative. While she stresses the importance of mass movements and especially of the rural movements in the Indian context, she makes no distinction between reform and revolution. In fact, revolution is not on her agenda at all. While her analysis of the origins of patriarchy deals with the role of the state in the ancient period, she does not deal with the state in the contemporary situation at all. Although she raises the question of the role of the state in the present incidence of violence on women she does not tackle the point at all. While the caste-class equations in rural India remain as they are, and with the extreme competitiveness within ruling class politics, how effective can women be in using these institutions to reduce violence against them? What have been the experiences of the past decade and a half in the experiment of women participating in Zilla Parishads and Panchayats? The question of political power is certainly crucial but women’s liberation cannot be taken forward by women gaining seats in the institutions of power in the present exploitative, corrupt set-up. Omvedt’s unwillingness to consider the concrete and difficult but necessary task of revolution, the overthrow of this state, rather, her rejection of this task, makes her whole analysis no different from that of liberal reformers. She also ignores the widespread movement of the Maoists in India and the part being played by women, particularly Adivasi women in it.</p>
<p>Omvedt has used the term traditional left to refer to all those who claim to uphold the Marxist analysis, particularly the communist parties. This is problematic because by using such an unscientific and sweeping term, Omvedt places into one basket Marxists of various hues, the Trotskyites, Maoists, CP(M)-type revisionists, etc. After Engels’ pioneering work, revolutionary Marxists around the world have taken many steps to tackle women’s oppression in the course of revolutionary movements and also after the revolution. In this context, the efforts made in China during the revolutionary movement and after, the formulations made by Mao, the theorizing during the Cultural Revolution and the practice initiated in that period, all that has to be taken into account before rejecting the ‘simplifications of Marxism.’ The mechanical interpretation and backwardness of some Indian Marxists on this question cannot be used to reject Marxism itself. This kind of selective use of history does not aid the women’s cause. The fact of the matter is that Omvedt emphasizes the role of violence in the subjugation of women, but she is unable to answer the question that arises from it — violence for what? If she replies for reproductive control, the question still arises, reproductive control for what purpose? Engels’ formulation was extremely complex — he tried to search for the material causes for women’s oppression within history and for this he interwove the economic (surplus, classes), the social (kinship, family) and the political factors (the rise of the state) together. The state is the instrument of violence, and it is necessary for subjugation.</p>
<p>Periyar’s views and Ambedkarism have also influenced the understanding of the women’s question in India. A large number of women from the Dalit castes have been mobilized by organizations that profess Ambedkarism, and it has gained adherents among a section of academics as well in the past decade. Ambedkar was deeply influenced by liberal philosophy and hence he actively strove to gain equality for the Dalits and women in India. The burning of the Manusmriti and the framing of the Hindu Code Bill (which was to give Hindu women rights in marriage, property, adoption, etc.) were the means by which he tried to highlight the plight of women in India. In the specific context of caste oppression in India, of which Dalits and women are the main sufferers, Ambedkar studied the source of caste oppression and its origins. In his works, <em>Who were the Shudras?</em>, he concluded that Hindu religion as developed by the Brahmins is responsible for the degraded condition of women and therefore campaigned to expose the essentially iniquitous nature of the religion. Periyar too exposed the Brahminical traditions that denied women equal status. Although this has meant that the focus of attack is on the traditional culture and the material conditions tend to be given less importance, yet, the link between caste and women’s oppression was first clearly articulated by the non-Brahmin movement in India.</p>
<p>While the influence of Gandhism was marginal when the women’s movement re-emerged in the 1970s in India, but later, in the 1990s, it has gained strong proponents in various well-known women thinkers like Madhu Kishwar and Vandana Shiva. There are considerable differences among them but both stress the importance of the non-violent method and are glorifying the precolonial traditions and the village community life. While Shiva has upheld the <em>prakriti</em> principle which showed women as an active force concerning nature, Madhu Kishwar has been supporting the Indian tradition and seeking elements within it which are empowering of women. She tends to defend tradition in all its aspects. Hence, she has been critical of women’s organizations that have attacked anti-women traditions like <em>sati</em>. According to her, we need to make a distinction between the forced immolation of widows, which is a criminal act, and the <em>sati</em> tradition which was a celebration of women’s power and spiritual superiority. Kishwar has emphasized that through the principle of self-sacrifice and loyalty women gained considerable support and clout within the family and community. She interprets the popularity of Sita as an ideal woman and wife too from the same perspective. The feudal ruling classes developed this patriarchal culture to ensure the continued subjugation of women. By internalizing these values women have sought to gain the approval of society — meaning, the dominant sections of the village or community. Behaviour based on this kind of internalization of patriarchal values could only have led to an illusion of power for women, which made their real enslavement invisible. Kishwar’s uncritical advocacy of the tradition fits into the postmodernist approach of hailing the local and emphasizing the question of identity. It goes against the basic interests of the mass of women who are oppressed by the feudal traditions that are still dominating and denied even their right to life by these very traditions and attitudes. By advocating non-violence as an absolute principle, they are denying women the right to choose the form of struggle that will take the struggle for liberation forward. Both Madhu Kishwar and Gail Omvedt are direct supporters of globalization. Flying in the face of facts, both are of the view that the WTO regime will give opportunities to the peasantry, women, Dalits, etc.</p>
<p>NGOs that are working among slum and rural women are also organizing women within the country. But a major section of them is involved in directly running the government-sponsored projects like self-help groups, micro-credit and community organizing. Most of these activities have been carried out with the help of either funds from the government or foreign donors, like Church organizations, foundations, etc. They are not part of the women’s movement but have taken the language and culture (songs, etc.) of the women’s movement while implementing the policies of the central and state governments among women. In this way, they are trying to pre-empt the growth of an independent women’s movement, and prevent women from joining the revolutionary struggle. A small section amongst them is also using the language of radical feminism to organize prostitutes and campaign for the legalization of prostitution in India. In this way, they are directly serving the interests of imperialists to develop sex tourism and a sex industry.</p>
<hr />
<p>The revolutionary women’s movement, under the theoretical guidance of Marxism, as it has been developed through experience by Lenin and Mao, has been successful in organizing women of the most oppressed castes and communities, the rural poor peasants and landless labourers. The movement has taken heed of the issues raised by the international women’s movement and considers the fight against patriarchy an integral part of the new democratic revolution. By studying the above trends critically, taking the positive points and integrating them with its theory and practice, can it realize its goal of liberating the vast masses of Indian women while successfully completing the revolution?</p>
